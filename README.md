 Intelligent Skin Disease Diagnosis Application

Overview
The Intelligent Skin Disease Diagnosis Application is a cutting-edge mobile app designed to enhance dermatological care using artificial intelligence. This application allows users to capture images of their skin conditions, receive AI-driven preliminary diagnoses, and access comprehensive information and nearby dermatology clinics. The platform aims to bridge the gap between initial concern and professional medical consultation, enhancing accessibility and quality of dermatological care.

 Features
- Image Capture and Analysis: Users can easily capture images of their skin ailments using the mobile application. These images are analyzed by AI models trained to identify common skin diseases.
- Confident Diagnosis: Upon analysis, users receive a diagnosis with a confidence level supported by AI algorithms. Relevant information from the World Health Organization (WHO) is also provided.
- Geolocation-Based Recommendations: The application utilizes geolocation data to suggest nearby dermatologist clinics, enhancing accessibility to professional medical assistance.
- Doctor's Diagnosis Comparison: Users can submit their images for a doctor's diagnosis to validate the AI diagnosis.
- Voluntary Data Contribution: Users can volunteer their images along with the doctor's diagnosis to the system, contributing to the continuous improvement of the AI models by enriching the dataset.
- Emphasis on Medical Consultation: The application underscores the importance of consulting a dermatologist for conclusive evaluations, serving as a supportive tool rather than a substitute for professional medical diagnosis.

 Technologies and Tools
- Artificial Intelligence (AI): Utilized for analyzing images and providing diagnoses.
- Mobile Application Development: Developed for Android devices using Flutter.
- Firebase: Used for database management, real-time data updates, and Authentication.
- Geolocation Services: Integrated to provide users with recommendations for nearby dermatologist clinics.
- User Authentication and Security: Ensured through robust authentication mechanisms to protect user data and privacy.
- Using for AI model FastAPI and Render Server.
